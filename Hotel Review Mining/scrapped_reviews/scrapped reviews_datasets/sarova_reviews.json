I think now is a good time. Firstly big thanks to my agent Zeno Safaris who always know how to ensure things are booked the way I like. Bigger thanks to the team at Sarova reservations who make it happen. With covid and all tourism has been hit and Whitesands being one of the biggest beach hotels in Mombasa they are truly doing all they can to keep up business as normal. That's a big achievement and kudos to the management of the hotel. Check-in to most Sarova Hotels is always warm and caring. Thats one of the hotels key pillars.  With covid the check in was fast and quick. Rooms are great. Get the pool facing ones if you can. All recently renovated in", "title": "Top Quality", "rating": "40", "date": " February 2021"},

They are in desperate need of renovation and the hotel has plans to start this process in the next couple of months, so please don't expect 5* luxury accommodation.

The hotel is renovating the rooms and had done two when we were there - which when we poked our heads around the door had been done well and were more akin to a 4* - they just need to speed it up!

A number of us had stayed at this hotel before but time round I got the sense that the standards have gone down.  The hotel has always defined \"5 star\" standards but this time I downgraded it to a \"4 star\".     My room (number 3086) was stale due to lack of air circulating and dust, perhaps a sign that no guest had stayed in that room for a long time.  This activated my sinus allergies and ended up ill.  The rooms need a serious upgrade.  The bath tubs and sinks have brown stains.  Generally not good at all.  In August, I stayed with my family at Leopard Beach Resort and Spa in Diani and that is what I define as true \"5 star\" experience.

I stayed for 5 days, working, and  if I had been on holiday may have disliked the number of conference people walking around as this detracts from the relaxed atmosphere.

When I booked this hotel, I requested 3 single beds in the room as there were 3 of us sharing. I had emailed the day before we left for Kenya to confirm my requests. We arrived at the hotel at 9am and had to call reception 5 times as well as having to go in person but still no extra bed.

We ordere lasagna and fish and mushroom soupe as a starter. As soon as we whereat the pool an other waiter said we had to pay for swimming (before it always was free). Yes and wifi is free for hotel guests too. Mushroom soup came. It was good,, kacked a bit of pepper and salt but mushrooms where tastable. Then came my gf fish. Fried instead of grilled, ugaly was coldand wrong vegetables. Fish was dry like a bisqitt and my gf had to fight with bones. 20 minutes later came my lasagne.

{"hotel": "Sarova Whitesands Beach Resort & Spa", "review": "We last stayed at White Sands 20 years ago and were grateful to see that the standard was still high \u2013 well maintained rooms and grounds, good service, and a variety of well-prepared food. The only downside was the late night noise from the Coco bar each night. Our son had planned to stay for five nights but checked out after the first night, because he couldn\u2019t sleep. Saturday night was the worst \u2013 karaoke until midnight. I\u2019m guessing there were probably 10-20 well-lubricated people keeping everyone else in the hotel awake with their loud caterwauling. We requested a change of rooms as far away from the bar as possible and slept very well after that. I highly recommend sea-facing rooms 2032-2037 for the quiet, and for an unobstructed view of the beach without any hawkers.", "title": "Nice stay \u2013 but beware the late night caterwauling!", "rating": "40", "date": " June 2018"},

{"hotel": "Sarova Whitesands Beach Resort & Spa", "review": "We stayed at the hotel from the 12/1 until 15/1 and returned after our safari on the 18/1 until the 23/1. As soon as we arrived at the hotel we were treated excellently. The staff gave us a cool flannel and drink while the check in process took place. As we were staying on an all-inclusive basis this was explained to us what was included. We were then guided to our room which was overlooking the Spa pool and gardens which is the quiet area of the hotel. The room was clean and tidy and met our requirements. The bathroom facilities were sufficient with a large walk in shower.  We used the Pavilion (buffet) and Minazi (a la carte) restaurant. We used the buffet for breakfast but mainly used the Minazi restaurant for lunch and dinner as this was included in the all-inclusive option.", "title": "Lovely hotel with great staff ", "rating": "50", "date": " January 2020"},

{"hotel": "Sarova Whitesands Beach Resort & Spa", "review": "My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is large and has direct beach access.  There are multiple pools and dining options.  The staff is also very friendly. We also opted to use the hotel\u2019s facilities for snorkeling and paddle boating. Everything you could want from a beach resort.  However, the hotel is starting to show its age.  In our bathroom the shower flooded ran over and flooded the floor leaving us with a lake.  The light switches were mostly all broken or didn\u2019t work and the door to balcony needed to be repaired.  The rooms are in need of an upgrade.  It was clear that we were here in the off season, many rooms were unoccupied. Given the state of the facilities I don\u2019t think the rates were priced accordingly.  The hotels on Diana beach are newer and only", "title": "3 Night Get Away, but...", "rating": "30", "date": " February 2020"},

{"hotel": "Sarova Whitesands Beach Resort & Spa", "review": "I am currently staying at this property having booked in tonight. I was expecting a really nice hotel having stayed at Sarova Mara and Sarova Nakuru over the last 3 nights. Unfortunately the room I was given was not even of 2 star standard. This also happened with 3 other guests in our party  The rooms are damp, smelly and with a air conditioner which does not dehumidify and fails to bring the room temperature below 24 C. The AC sucks the exhaust gases from the kitchen which is a health hazard. We all complained to the reception with no response. They only sent someone to spray a air freshener which worsened the situation. Appalling customer service. Avoid at all costs.", "title": "Weekend chillex", "rating": "50", "date": " February 2020"},
