I think now is a good time. Firstly big thanks to my agent Zeno Safaris who always know how to ensure things are booked the way I like. Bigger thanks to the team at Sarova reservations who make it happen. With covid and all tourism has been hit and Whitesands being one of the biggest beach hotels in Mombasa they are truly doing all they can to keep up business as normal. That's a big achievement and kudos to the management of the hotel. Check-in to most Sarova Hotels is always warm and caring. Thats one of the hotels key pillars.

Sadly, they didn't serve lunch, last i remember, nonetheless they had a couple of restaurants to offer.  It is a family hotel, that both parents and children can have fun.

What made the stay at Whitesands was the staff. Ahmed and Joel- (recreational attendant), welcomed my family and me. They were friendly, polite and caring. As the hotel is on the public beach, going for a walk with them meant we could enjoy a stroll without being bothered by the locals. Ahmed caring nature came across through his care for mum, ensuring she did not loose her balance when the waves came in.

What I love about this hotel is the staff who are excellent, the pool areas which are varied and great for families, the waterspouts club and the location.  The rooms can be hit and miss - the newer wing is great (we went last in June 2011).  In the past we have asked to move if we haven't liked the room and find the hotel amenable to this if they can.  Food is good but we tend eat out a lot - there are some great places to eat in Mombasa.  The beach bar is a really nice place to hang out.  There are some fabulous places to go out in Mombasa well located from the hotel.

Still a lovely hotel, with nice layout for holiday relaxation and conferences. The service is good and the staff quite helpful. This time I arrived late in the night and had to leave early for meetings -- the check in and out process could be more efficient.   I was quite disappointed by the room service staff insisting that I should take the late night buffet for dinner, which turned out to have limited food choices - not necessarily the choices a guest may want late in the night. I was allocated a very big room with two double beds and what seemed like a dump of furniture. The room was not properly cleaned - the floors were dusty. I politely inquired whether there was no better room and the check-in lady", "title": "Nice holiday resort", "rating": "40", "date": " December 2014"},

However, I found the hotel lacked charm and certainly the previous gripes on this site regarding late housekeeping (most days not done before 4pm) and no beach towels before 930/10am are correct.   I stayed for 5 days, working, and  if I had been on holiday may have disliked the number of conference people walking around as this detracts from the relaxed atmosphere.  However, I must reiterate the grounds are lovely and it is big enough to find a quiet spot. Overall a nice place although not amazing.

{"hotel": "Sarova Whitesands Beach Resort & Spa", "review": "This is the third Sarova hotel I\u2019ve stayed at and the vibe here is quite different to the others (Lion Hill and Mara Camp).  This hotel is HUGE.   Pros: It\u2019s right on the beach, so you can wake up to the sunrise and if you\u2019re early enough, you can dash down to the beach for a sunrise swim before the beach sellers start setting up for the day. The spa area is incredible, the ladies who work there are so professional.  There\u2019s also a discount if you book your appointment in the morning, which makes the treatments much more affordable. The main pool has a swim up bar\u2026 and there\u2019s an adult pool where you can chill out if that\u2019s not enough to tempt you toward the family infested waters of the main pool!

The spa was also really really good and very reasonably priced; we were really impressed. The resort itself is nice.  On the downside, the second you set foot on the beach and off the hotel premises you get hassled by beach sellers. There is no longer a PADI dive centre any more as apparently the locals (who make up the majority of their clientele) don't dive; so if you came hoping to get in some dives, think again; the description on TripAdvisor is wrong.

{"hotel": "Sarova Whitesands Beach Resort & Spa", "review": "We stayed at the resort for four nights with our children and everyone had a fantastic time. Everyone from the check in staff, catering and gardening were friendly and helpful. The kids spent some time with the ozone teenage group and the carers were brilliant with them. We found the choice of food to be extensive and well prepared. The evening entertainment was varied but we especially liked the acrobatic act.

Being in the industry... I noticed their emphasis on covid protocols which were being observed. The Food and Beverage was a notch higher because our eating venues kept changing and everything was superb!!! From food variety to service... happy faces all over. We checked out today but I've booked again for NYE... cant miss the Shomajodzi show!!!! They had an interesting concept of a food village and tagging us for meal periods during dinner...

While  the rooms and other amenities are constantly getting a facelift and being improved, the customer experience has been on a steady decline. I had multiple hitches from check in-  the gentleman escorting me to my room got lost and had me dragging my luggage up and down  countless flights of stairs as he tried to figure his way out, then once we found my room he  spent 13  minutes trying to explain to me  how the lights worked (he seemed lost as well). He then left without actually providing the relevant information like WiFi and I had to call the  reception to have it sorted.The pool area  was always littered with used towels and I never laid", "title": "Fabulous getaway.", "rating": "50", "date": " December 2020"},

{"hotel": "Sarova Whitesands Beach Resort & Spa", "review": "We stayed in three Sarova properties on our recent trip to Kenya. The first two (Mara Game Camp and Lion Hill) were very good. White Sands was flat-out terrible. There is no question that it is a beautiful property, but I can't think of anything else about the place that worked as well as a typical 2-Star resort. The check-in process was horrible. After first informing us that we had no reservation, they then admitted that they gave our room away to someone who extended their stay. What's worse is that they did not have replacement room ready until 3:30 PM! Service at the Lido Bar is non-existent. Our in-room safe did not work and they were in no rush to fix it. There were no robes in our room. There was only one chair on our balcony. Our waiter admitted that they rarely have", "title": "Really Poorly Run Resort", "rating": "10", "date": " November 2020"},

What transpired during and after my injury is the reason I have rated sarova poorly. 1- Response rate was slow and they lacked coordination in terms of who to call for first aid and what to do. Clinical officer arrived eventually after more than 20min. During this time I was bleeding profusely and the only persons who stepped up to help were the pool attendant and a guard.  2.First aid boxes are not well equipped.ran out of some materials. 3.There were some", "title": "Abhorrent safety standards and response.", "rating": "10", "date": " November 2020"},
