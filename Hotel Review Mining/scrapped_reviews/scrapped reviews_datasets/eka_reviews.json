{"hotel": "Eka Hotel Nairobi", "review": "Such a lovely place to be, check in was good, good food but the problem began when we wanted to purchase items at the souvenir shop. There was no shop attendant,  the service was bad we had to select some staff with more than one staff monitoring us. A security officer and and a door person. Then we were kept on hold since they had to make calls to someone elsewhere who assisted them until we were done. The shop is very beautiful with the best selection of different crafts, clothing and books and well arranged  but why can't the hotel get an attendant who will always be ready to serve customers? That is business and because of that some of my colleagues could not shop there yet they really wanted to. You need someone who can explain to your clients what they are buying and leave", "title": "Disappointment", "rating": "30", "date": " October 2020"},

I was in Nairobi for one night following a safari so did not have an issue that it was far from the city as I did not have time to explore. The room was comfortable although the WIFi was not great in the room so I had to come to reception to get a good connection. I used hotel transport to the airport the next day and even though we were close to the airport there was a major traffic jam and it still took some time. The driver did his best to get around the traffic where possible.

Another big plus was that we wanted to re-visit the David Sheldrick Elephant Sanctuary and the Giraffe Centre in the Karen district and again the route from the hotel was relatively traffic-free.

The bad: Just finishing my eight night average wait time from ordering dinner to being served is 1 hour. Getting drinks at the bar is also e trembly slow. There is plenty of staff but none pays attention to the customers. However, with he hookers it is a different story. They are more than ready to ake care of business and pay very close attention to possible clients. Also in the same building is a steak house named Spurs. While the service is slightly better 45 minutes o get served the food is horrible. I have eaten there twice. First I had a steak nasty, couldn't finish it. A few nights later I tried the grilled shrimp. They were horrible for about 45 dollars. Grilled it oil and well done", "title": "Great Hotel and great food", "rating": "50", "date": " October 2018"},

The room was adequate and welcome after a long flight. It had the basics and was comfortable. The room service was awesome. Also, the hotel hosts an amazing BBQ restaurant which I will try next time. This time we wanted to have something simple due to long journey. We has pasta and spaghetti. Also, the potato soup was good. The highlight for me was the breakfast the next day. The bread and the coffee simply out of the world. We will choose this place every time during our holidays to Kenya.

{"hotel": "Eka Hotel Nairobi", "review": "Stayed here a couple times at either end of a safari trip to the Masai Mara. The first time for two nights on arrival in Kenya and the second just as a day room before our later flight back to london. The rooms are well structured with everything you need, the shower works well, the beds are comfortable and the room is very claen and organised. The staff we met were friendly and professional and could answer the few questions we had. Breakfast buffet was all that you need with excellent coffee and service was prompt. We aslo are in restaurant a couple of time can definitely recommend the chick stir fry and rice - so good I had it twice! There was also a singer oneevening and jazz musicians which added to the ambience. There isn't much in the surrounding area apart from the mall", "title": "Pleaseant hotel, where evrything works really well", "rating": "50", "date": " February 2020"},

AC in the room is working perfect. Small disadvandtage is the temperature in the lobby and restaurant. It was very hot and humid. Not very pleasant when eating your meal. Not sure if the AC was switched off or broken, but it would be nice to have that on. I do not remember this from previous stays, so perhaps it was a one time issue.
