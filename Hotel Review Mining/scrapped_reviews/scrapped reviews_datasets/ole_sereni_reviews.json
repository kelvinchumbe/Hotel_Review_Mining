We had all the booking confirmation emails with us, they had our credit card as security and nothing - they didn't give a toss. We asked for the duty manager and to say he didn't care about leaving six tourists high and dry in Nairobi after midnight is an understatement!! he even stood in the lobby and watched us leave without as much as an apology.

Our bags arrived in our room within 10 minutes of check in.  The room was smallish, but just fine as you're only there to sleep anyways.  We had dinner at the lounge as we only wanted something light and it was very good.  However we had to be out to catch a plane at 5:30am; we asked the front desk for a breakfast box and were told that that wouldn't be necessary as the breakfast buffet was open at 4:30.  Excellent we thought.  Well, it turns out the staff might show up at 4:30am, but they sure aren't ready to serve you anything until about 5:30am.  Note this if you have to leave early.

Asked for a fan, to be told that they don't have any fans anywhere in the hotel. When asked what else I could do to cool the room down was told to open the window. As Kenya is a high risk malaria country and as per my companies guidelines, (due to the recent deaths of two of my colleagues caused by malaria), I wasn't going to open the window. I said this to the staff who dismissed my concerns and said 'don't worry, it will be fine'. Not prepared to take this risk", "title": "Rude staff and rooms hotter than the sun!

We headed to Eagle's lounge where an acoustic band plays every Wednesday. We ordered cocktails, potato wedges and chicken wings. I must say, the chicken wings are the best I have had anywhere in Nairobi! The service was quick and attentive with very friendly waitstaff.  I love the wall hangings outside the washrooms, very unique and eyecatching!
