Friendly staff from the security to the housekeeping staff. All wore a smile on their face and it was genuine especially because they were very responsive.  Used the conference hall- great service, wi-fi, space and teas. Consider increasing the number of washrooms to be used by conference venue users. Meals were great...variety and of great quality accompanied by lots of fruits. Stayed in the standard room which was comfortable for me. It was chilly at night and they went ahead to provide hot water bottles :-) The insect repellents were useful too.

Dinner was an amazing buffet and all staff are so welcoming and helpful. After dinner we enjoyed coffee/tea sitting at a bonfire on the patio adjacent to the bar. Great way to end the day.

The room was nice enough, a bit tired but still of a decent standard.   There was a bit of a pretentious vibe about the place we thought... we stayed at some less expensive places that were equally as nice or nicer to be honest without that feeling but maybe that was because we had come from a small intimate camp to a big hotel...?

Food was of a good quality in the restaurants and there is a pool to swim in if you have time.   The lodges are decent and had a mosquito net in which is closed for you at night. The staff even left a hot watering bottle in our bed as it was raining and quite cold.

However, I spent very little time there, as the grounds adjoining Lake Nakuru National Park, along with those amazing birds and hotel dining and bar amenities drew me out.

It offers excellent access to the park for game drives but is surprisingly close to the large town of Nakaru. The town is well out of site though. The proximity to town results in a lot of day time business meeting and conference business which does affect the ambiance a bit. It feels like a larger facility than some of the more intimate Sarova lodges. The restaurant was large and surprisingly busy at lunch time but was quiet in the evening. This reflects the relatively small proportion of safari business. It is a shame more people don't safari here because the rhino sightings were excellent.

That is besides the close-ups one can get of white rhino, cape buffaloes, Rothschild's giraffe and if you are lucky,  by sighting of leopards. Sarova Lion Hill Game Lodge retains its old-world charm, with large bed-steads in large bed-rooms, gentle walk-ways and a fine dining area.

{"hotel": "Sarova Lion Hill Game Lodge", "review": "So let me be honest - Lodges are not normally my thing.  I generally prefer smaller boutique style places or self catering homes but I was really pleasantly surprised by my recent stay at Lion Hill.  First off - the staff were amazing.  Really genuinely friendly and helpful - the manager, the dining room staff, the chef's and the askari (who reminded me twice that I'd left a window open on my car.)  There was a large family with a disabled child staying who had been offered sponsorship by Sarova whilst their home was being made over for a TV show.  They were obviously not used to any level of luxury at all and I watched the staff carefully as they dealt with them, expecting a bit of condescension at the very least. Instead, they were all so respectful and kind, it was", "title": "Incredible level of service", "rating": "50", "date": " November 2020"},
