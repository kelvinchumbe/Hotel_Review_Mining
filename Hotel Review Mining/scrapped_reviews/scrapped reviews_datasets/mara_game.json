I wanted to avoid the places that just throw up some tarp over a cement floor and try to ride the trend.  Sarova Mara Camp was not like that at all. They really do the 'tented camp' with panache.  In the bush it is really good taste and attention to detail (IMHO) that really makes a place.  I think this can be especially important for first-timers in Africa.

My wife was so impressed with this hotel way more than any other hotel we have been. the reception was very friendly and answers queries truthfully. we dont see that everyday. the food was good but the attention you get from the people there is just too good. chef Gilbert was the highlight for us. we stayed there for 6 nights and we had one of the club tents. thanks to their service of guiding us to our tents in the night, just gives u that extra comfort at night.  they arranged for a breakfast in the garden for us which just put the cherry on the top. this is one of the best hotels we have been to and would definitely go back there in our next trip to Kenya.", "title": "One of the best places one can stay", "rating": "50", "date": " July 2013"},

The Club Tents looked much nicer to us, although we had a standard one. We were a fair way away in the 50's in terms of tent numbers. It's not the real tent experience as there is an electric fence around the compound. I think it was a good introduction to the Masai, and we were well looked after. The staff were initially a bit reserved, but very friendly.  A birthday celebration for one of our party was memorable for its enthusiasm and the African take on a birthday song.

The live grills, choice of meat, desserts and the hospitality of the hotel was fantastic. They really made us feel at home. There are options of choosing to do a meal in the open forest, or opting to see a Maasai village or even do a hot air balloon and all of is you can do a booking within the hotel.

Great location right inside the park--which is key if you've been on the road to the park for the last two hours (if you have a bad back, skip Masai Mara as you won't be able to walk after that drive.)  Only criticism was the food--I HATE Indian food and this seems to be a thing with Sarova Hotels.  Fully half of the choices are Indian type food (nasty!)  Warning--if you get back from your game drive late, the KWS/County authorities will be waiting at the entrance to the hotel to fine your driver.

The food was fantastic, the rooms like something out of a dream, the safari excursions totally a pleasure.  The only bump my group and I had was because we had not reviewed the mara reserve's rules, so one of our number broke a reserve rule (\"do not sit on top of vehicles\") and we got pulled over by the reserve's rangers.
