They are not clueless on what they are selling, as in every item has its own story which I found to be very outstanding, that aside, the service is excellent, world-class. One upside though was the constant lack of top up cards. The ladies were kind enough to actually go out of their way n got someone to fetch some from outside.

The two stays felt so incredibly different, you would think we were in two different hotels.  For our first visit, my husband and I arrived at the Sankara very late on a Saturday evening after over 18 hours of travel from NYC. Our first impression was great. Very tight but friendly security, front desk clerk was efficient and welcoming. We received an upgrade. Room on the second floor. Nice bathroom.   Very clean. Cozy bed. Room service was ordered - a veg burger and a beef burger. Both arrived after about 45 min, and were quite tasty. We stayed 2 nights (Saturday and Sunday) and enjoyed a truly excellent Indian meal in the downstairs restaurant on our final evening as well as drinks on the rooftop lounge.", "title": "A tale of two VERY different hotels", "rating": "20", "date": " November 2013"},

I can only say positive things about my experience. The hotel staff were friendly and highly professional. My room was tastefully decorated and very comfortable. A very cute touch was the little big 5 animal stone figurines that they leave on your night table (way better than a chocolate). I dined at the rooftop pool restaurant for dinner and lunch. The menu was simple and offered a wide selection of beverages. The hotel was very accommodating with changes made by my fellow business travelers.

Not great if you want the adventure of being in Kenya.  What did not work well at all was the reservation.  I had booked on the hotel's website, but was sent on a wild goose chase to Expedia (and other travel sites I had not heard of) to make a change.

As for the WiFi, the hotel management was dillegently working to improve reception while I was there. The sturdy concrete construction of the hotel had an impact on signal strength in some spotts, prompting them to install repeaters in some to extend coverage.

The roast potatoes were literally crisps. Lunch was better, though not the best. I particularly liked the dessert. The juices and sodas had a very weird unpleasant taste. Service was slow too.

The room was well-appointed with a nice view, but things went downhill from there.

{"hotel": "Sankara Nairobi, Autograph Collection by Marriott", "review": "Everything about this hotel was great and it is certainly now my preferred place to stay when visiting Nairobi for business (or pleasure). Every member of the staff with whom I interacted was friendly and helpful. The room was great - spacious, clean and well maintained by the house keeping staff. The food at the restaurant - which also handles room service - was amazing. Literally one of the best salmon dishes I have ever had (I ordered it on three of the nights I stayed at the hotel) and beet root salad was also delicious. In addition, the executive lounge was nice and offered a substantial breakfast. Plus, Sankara has a very well equipped gym with bikes, elliptical, treadmills, rower, free weights and machines. I also appreciated that this hotel is not a giant property, so", "title": "Friendly staff, incredible food, nice rooms", "rating": "50", "date": " December 2019"},

{"hotel": "Sankara Nairobi, Autograph Collection by Marriott", "review": "Stayed at Sankara twice recently with the family on our first trip to Nairobi. Chose the suite which was more spacious and was upgraded with lounge access. Beautiful hotel with great service all around coupled with well appointed and luxuriously furnished suite. Ample armed security personnel were visible around the hotel and these were reassuring to us.   I saw a plague indicating Sankara Nairobi being  awarded the 2019 Africa winner for best luxury boutique hotel - truly a deserving award in my view.

{"hotel": "Sankara Nairobi, Autograph Collection by Marriott", "review": "My third time visiting clients in Nairobi and the Sankara is the first and only hotel in mind when visiting. A high level of customer service from the minute you enter the hotel with friendly staff such as John and Solomon on the door with Frida and Nicholas on the reception. The staff have clearly been trained to a very high level as they make every effort to remember you and welcome you on arrival and through the security.   The rooms are of a very high standard with a lovely desk area for working and a luxurious bath and shower facility. Hilda in house-keeping went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure my room was comfortable and tidy.  A great gym facility with smith machine, Olympic weight-lifting bar, running machine, rowing machine and cycles.
