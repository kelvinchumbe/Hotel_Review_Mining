There was a buzz of activity and movement  at the lobby for about an hour.  The hotel porters moved with speed, supervisors gave military instructions and kitchen staff and waiters seemed harassed. This is not a very good picture for the hotel and I suggest that the hotel creates a holding area, lobby of sorts....to hold conferencing and banqueting guests as rooms are turned over.  Overall, we had a sumptuous dinner, experienced a mature, friendly and extremely professional coordinator (Mary), got two rooms on concession for the ladies to touch up their make-up, professional barmen, kind though timid waiters (some training will be good),  and enjoyed ourselves.

{"hotel": "Sarova Panafric", "review": "Although I stayed in the both the Highlands and the PanAfric, this review will focus principally on the PanAfric becasue my stay was longer. However, I will say that the Highlands was a lovely, new hotel with a dedicated professionall staff. However my stay at the Panafric was longer and the stay was excellent. Rarely have I been anywhere, and I have stayed in many hotels throughout the world, where the staff was more professional, friendly and helpful. The hotel is undergoing a renovation which caused some inconvienence,but the staff took every measure to ensure that I was comfortable. My room was spacious, modern and well catered every day. As I said, the staff from top to bottom was superb in their dedication and professionalism. As for the hotel itself, it is centrally", "title": "I visited two Sarova hotels while in Kenya during January, 2020, the Sarova Panafric in Nairobi and the Nakuru Highlands", "rating": "50", "date": " January 2020"},
