{"hotel": "Sarova Stanley", "review": "This is a hotel with a lot of history.  I loved reading about the history and the people who stayed there.   We stayed overnight before returning to the UK.  We got the room at a very low rate because of demand being so low because of the coronavirus and so many people not travelling.   I am normally not a 5 star hotel person.  I prefer, medium, clean and basic hotels (just my preference).  But, I have to say, the staff were so lovely.  In fact, the staff made the place.  Yes, the hotel is well located, is clean, has lots of services and all that but...it IS the staff that was the highlight.  So friendly, so helpful, so kind ....really it was great.    Because of the virus issues the pool was closed and so was the gym.  Also, because of how quiet it was only one restaurant was", "title": "Good Quality Hotel with Lovely Staff", "rating": "40", "date": " March 2020"},

The exchange bar is of the highest quality, yes its a little more expensive than some places, but if you require a 1st class service then you will clearly see where that extra few shillings is going. If you have a love for Thai food, then you are in for a treat, the restaurant is authentic and will will be offered a complimentary head and neck massage as you are waiting for your meal to be prepared.

Hence still a five star review for an otherwise perfect stay in a very comfortable historic hotel very much in the centre of Nairobi. Tusker beer was famously first tried in the hotel in 1922 - and the Nairobi stock exchange started in what is now called the Exchange Bar.  Received an upgrade to a suite with separate bed- and living room (which was very nice of them for a single night stay). It was however on the very busy streetside but thanks to good soundproofing (a.o. double windows) and perhaps a bit of soft white noise from the well-working airconditioner, the traffic noise was no problem at all.   The rooftop pool of the Stanley is wonderful, the water is nicely", "title": "Good soundproofing - Nice heated rooftop pool", "rating": "50", "date": " April 2017"},

During our recent stay we noticed that in the outdoor space was under the shade of an acacia tree (or a related species). Guests staying at the SSH had posted warm notes of praise. I later found out the tree was the first \"post office\" in NBO as it stood at a major crossroad of NBO way back then.  In the absence of a postal system the tree was the postal delivery person! The hotel may be historic but has been updated, and retains many of the historic touches  Our first brush with Kenya, and Africa was at the SSH. We arrived after being on the airways for 24+ hours!

Our room for the first stay had a problem with the air conditioning, which we endured.  Located on a low (2nd) floor overlooking the internal courtyard. We had requested a quiet location, which it was. Upon checkout, we mentioned the a/c problem and requested a \"better room\" upon our return 8 days later.

It is very well-maintained, our kiddos loved the pool, and the customer service was truly exceptional. We especially enjoyed Benson, our waiter at the TT Restaurant - he is a true gem; kind, hard-working, earnest, and a winning smile.

{"hotel": "Sarova Stanley", "review": "This hotel is very beautiful and sparkling clean. Everyone from the entrance makes you feel welcome and at home. The only downside is the service at the thorn tree restaurant. The waiter that served me brought me the wrong order because she was in a hurry and not keen to listen me. My order took forever to come yet the restaurant had less than ten people. I hope the management looks into this issue in order not to lower the standards of this magnificent hotel.", "title": "EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE AT THE THORN TREE RESTAURANT.", "rating": "50", "date": " January 2020"},
{"hotel": "Sarova Stanley", "review": "Stayed here for a week over Christmas for the 1st time on 7 years. This has always been my favourite hotel in town and still is but the old girl is looking a little tatty in places.  There were still some great touches like the giant gingerbread house cladding around the lift lobby (with real gingerbread).  There is no escaping the food and drinks prices within the hotel are high but you stay in 5 star hotels, you pay 5 star prices.  The real asset of this hotel is its staff and they are still top notch. We had not visited in 7 years but many of the staff remembered us and genuinely took an interest in us. My little daughter was very ill overnight whilst we were there and needed medical treatment. The support from Richard, the duty manager was exemplary included arranging", "title": "Grand Old Lady is probably due some TLC", "rating": "40", "date": " December 2019"},

{"hotel": "Sarova Stanley", "review": "We went to Nairobi location.   Last two days of our honeymoon.  The managers were not welcoming and rude. They charged us $25 per day for breakfast.  Of all the top hotels in Nairobi it had most expensive food (minimum $18 a plate) and it was tasteless.  The bottles of water are $8 each.   The $25 breakfast has flies everywhere and stale food.   The room had a moldy smell with old fruit rotting in drawers. The beds were uncomfortable.  I think others have seen the same as the hotel was virtually empty.

{"hotel": "Sarova Stanley", "review": "A friend and I booked to stay in the Sarova Stanley, Nairobi for a week recently. We could happily, and comfortably, have stayed longer. Some of the highlights: samosas on the 5th floor, the Thai restaurant, the cocktail bar with great heated nuts and the Friday Swahili breakfast. Wow! The biggest highlights were the fantastic service and the amazing staff. Everyone greeted you, everyone was welcoming. Some standouts were the security staff on the entrance who escorted two bemused travellers across the chaotic traffic to the bank, found cabs for us and greeted us on any return to the hotel like returning friends; there was a waiter on the 5th floor with an infectious giggle who made us laugh; there was the concierge, Steve, who  did not miss an opportunity to talk about the", "title": "A great place to stay", "rating": "50", "date": " October 2019"},
