We actually had to fight for them not to charge us for the food that had maggots in it. They still charged us for the other plates.

{"hotel": "Sarova Stanley", "review": "The hotel has a lot of heritage behind it (all kinds of famous guests) as commemorated in various old photos on the walls: we'd certainly recommend as a central Nairobi base. The rooms are elegant, spacious, quiet and air-conditioned, and have a safe. One day we unfortunately forgot to lock the safe - no problem, the hotel management locked it in our absence, and were very careful to check that nothing had been taken (it hadn't). The staff are unfailingly friendly, and can organise taxis and restaurant reservations. Dining in isn't cheap, but it is excellent and convenient (the poolside bar is a charming al fresco spot). The Swahili breakfast on Friday mornings is a real gourmet treat (delicious mahamri, cooked fresh right in front of you, and spiced coffee!).

The sleeping accommodation was like glamping but the bathroom was like a resort. The bed was very comfortable and it was quiet at night except for the screaming tree hydrax's. Don't be alarmed by the sceeching they make. It only added to your wildlife experience. The only criticism of the tent was that as a tall person, I had to duck to walk around the edges of the tent inside. The grounds were beautiful. Due to the size of the grounds, it may be quite a walk from the restaurant to your room. Security was present but unobtrusive. The restaurant selection was amazing for all meals.

If adventurous eating is an important part of your experience, this is a hotel you'll want to visit. Make sure to try the ugali and have someone show you the right way to eat it! Know that some of the food is quite spicy, but there's always yogurt available if it gets to be too much.  A word on animals: though the lodge is fenced against bigger animals, some smaller species can be found on the grounds. Personally, I saw a pair of dik-diks and a large group of banded mongoose. As a person who loves animals, I was elated to see them so up-close, but my sister was less than thrilled when her husband didn't completely zip their tent", "title": "Great for Adventurers, Animal Lovers, and Life-Long Learners", "rating": "50", "date": " August 2018"},

The rooms had everything you could need.  The location of the camp was ideal and abundant wildlife was present around the camp.  My only very minor complaint would be the food quality.  Although there are numerous food options, I would characterize the food as being 3 star quality typically instead of 4 or 5.  Admittedly, I am a relatively picky eater and my opinion may only apply to a typical American.  Red snapper was ok, pasta good.

I must emphasise that this is no criticism of the lodge, but because of fellow guests here I might look for adult only accommodation another time. Which would be a huge shame. Perhaps a smaller separate area for adults only relaxing between drives would be an idea? Thanks for an otherwise incredible stay.

Points the hotel should work on are as follows: a) Hotel phones rarely answered by front desk, concierge, duty manager, easier to call duty manager on his or her personal cell phone which should never be the case. b) Hotel needs to corral conference crowds appropriately in order not to interfere /disturb  regular guests.  Lastly, room light switches wiring needs to be reconfigured, for example turn on reading light for bed side, and entire room lights up!

The Stanley belongs to another age and proundly displays it with its fine old architecture (strictly Queen Victorian) and excellent service.
