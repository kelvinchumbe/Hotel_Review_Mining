The hotel's very friendly lady said a view of river is now obstructed by construction, so recommended a street view - I agreed, but she added that there is no guarantee about early check-in but she put a note on my file.

Just note that the hotel is  just on the edge of the congestion zone so if you drive, don't forget to pay the CC Charge otherwise its 60 GBP.  When we arrived they couldn't find our booking but after a drink at the bar (not the cheapest) they had found our reservation. They upgraded the room which included a free half bottle of wine and they also threw in breakfast. Only downside (if any) was it was a disabled room so it had a walk in shower.

It allowed me to experience London, and as the hotel was fairly new, standards were extremely high.  This remains an excellent offering from Hilton but as it has established itself, prices are starting to go up, standards are starting to slip a bit, resulting in slightly less value for the money.  What I liked:  Although not requested, special sleeping accommodations were provided for the little one and the room was prepared for 3 guests (towels, bathroom amenities,...).  This is something that is often overlooked with Hilton's in North America so this was greatly appreciated.  The hotel is modern and in very good shape.

The location, so close to London Bridge underground station on the Northern line, was the main reason we chose this hotel. It proved to be a good choice. The rooms (as a Hilton H Honours member, I was upgraded to an executive double) were spacious and comfortable, although the lighting for hair and makeup wasn't the best (according to my wife). I said \"rooms\" because the 1st room, on what I think was the East (or London Bridge) side, was a little noisy at night, and we were moved to a much quieter room on the other side of the building. The building and fitout is modern, and everything worked well. The atmosphere was classic Hilton: a little impersonal, but efficient. The staff were terrific.

I did try the cocktails and they were good with great romantic night feel to the place, if you like that sort of thing.    From the rooms, great views of london, just stunning!

The water from the cold tap also tasted nasty, which is not great when you wake up needing some water in the middle of the night and don't have any bottled water left. The A/C was also loud, but turning it off meant being in a really hot room as having the window open was too noisy.

{"hotel": "Hilton London Tower Bridge", "review": "This hotel is not exactly central London but it is worth saving a bit because prices are lower and rooms, bar, restaurant and executive lounge are excellent.  Had rooms with two double beds and lounge privileges.  Rooms very comfortable -- worth getting slightly larger sized if you can -- and lounge has decent complete breakfast.  Bathrooms have separate shower and tub, the latter a good soaker. Bar is a bit noisy at night but better than wandering looking for pub.  Good wine selection. The hotel is a short walk to Globe Theater, HMS Belfast, The Tower of London and even St. Pauls.  Close to Thames.  London Bridge station is nearby and Waterloo station only two stops away leaving easy access to London. Place is definitely worth it.  Front desk is only issue.

The rooms were clean and well equipped and the beds very comfortable.

Just down the road you find the Tower Bridge tube station which give you access to all parts of the city for \u00a312 a day.   I would not recommend the use of taxis as the traffic is incredibly busy and the time and cost is far more than the tube, although you do get to see some of the famous landmarks.

In our boys room they placed some banners and balloons, and a special dessert, to celebrate his 18th birthday . This was a very nice touch and was much appreciated.  I will say the bar prices are spectacularly over the top, but that's the only real negative.

After checking in to my pre-paid room, I noticed an immediate charge for 150 pounds. When I questioned the front desk clerk, he stated that charge was a security deposit - 50 pounds for each night I was staying.

The cookie at check in was certainly a lovely touch, simple yet effective when you have travelled!  The lady at reception offered for us to join the Hilton Loyalty Member service which we did as this entitles you to free wifi, access to a lounge and other bonuses across Hilton hotels worldwide.  The room itself (on the 10th floor) had a terrible view due to building works but the rest of the hotel made up for this. The room itself was nice and bright and comfortable with a nice, clean bathroom and good shower.  Room service ends quite early which is good to note.

Check in was smooth and courteous and our room was of a decent size.  We had a bit of a mix up with keys not working on Saturday morning, but this was sorted out quickly by the reception staff.  The wc in the bathroom was jammed between a wall and the shower cubicle which made it a little snug.  The bathroom would be better off without the great big bath and just have a shower thus giving more room for a wc and perhaps a bidet.  I would think hat very few people use a bath these days.

It\u2019s directly in front of the London Bridge station so getting around the city is incredibly convenient. Lots of easy access to convenience stores, great restaurants, bars, and pubs.

Here you get free hot & cold breakfast, drinks, cakes and snacks all day and eve, including alcoholic drinks at night. My one fault would be, make the terrace no smoking, just too small to mix.

The room location was quiet apart from the bathroom door which had a loud scrapping noise on opening and closing. It needs oiling. Not great during the night, also trying to get just the bathroom light to work was somewhat of a technique. That said we had a good night and wish we were staying longer as its in a great location. Who ever organised a bottle of fizz and macarons in our room was a lovely touch so thank you.

Large bathroom and bedroom with king size bed. I endorsed very thin eiderdown- yet quite warm and thick pillows- thank you Hilton-  I had a lovely sleep :)  Among positives- a kettle hidden in the cabinet next to the fridge (mini bar) and to my surprise it had a sticker with a short description; mini bar space for personal items- quite useful when you\u2019re on a biz trip.

Staffs are friendly, quick and very efficient. Our room had a view of Shard. I definitely recommend staying here, if your travel/business is in the surrounding area.

I only used half of the mixer as the drink didn\u2019t seem that strong. I assumed the barman had given me a single measure by mistake. I ordered another double and used the other half of the mixer. Again, the drink tasted a bit stronger but not as strong as expected with only half a mixer. My bill then came and I was charged \u00a37.50 per measure. When I looked at the menu, it stated \u00a37.50 per 35ml. I went to the bar to say that obviously they had not put 70ml of alcohol in my glass. They insisted they had put 2 measures of 35ml in my glass so effectively a treble measure. I\u2019ve never heard of anywhere serving 70ml doubles.
