Emailed the hotel before we arrived to see if they can move me to a refurbished room (which is on on a separte wing) and they responded promptly and they confirmed it 2 days before check-in. Room was good. Didn't mind the decor too much since there were some reviews saying it looked old. Yes, it is not very modern but it was perfectly fine.  Regarding other reviews about walking miles to get to the room- it was not a very big deal at all and did not think it was an issue since it was less then 2", "title": "Good overnight stay- Ask for a refurbished room", "rating": "50", "date": " March 2020"},

My dad has stayed in this hotel on multiple occasions and is a long-time Hilton member so when I stayed here with my family in late October this year I did not think I had any reason to be cautious. Given that, I left a pair of Quay sunglasses in their sunglass case on the desk next to the coffee machine when we went out for dinner one of the nights. My parents had also left belongings out, including other pairs of reading glasses and sunglasses. When I went to look for the glasses in the morning they were gone. We tore the room apart and emptied all of our bags and they were nowhere to be found. Given that those glasses did not leave the room, they were obviously stolen. We reported this issue to the hotel and the issue was avoided, with the Hilton Guest", "title": "Terrible Experience Resulting in Theft and Denial", "rating": "10", "date": " October 2018"},

The hotel was booked as part of a 'park and stay' package with parking at the Purple Parking site in Lowfield Road included in the price we paid. As we booked well in advance the price we paid was quite reasonable, however, although it was fine for us, I think the price paid reflected the quality of the room we had as it was certainly in need of some updating. The good thing was however that it was a long way away from the main restaurants and bars so was very quiet. WiFi was available but at a charge which I think is very outdated in this day and age.

A note to management, don't put profit above service, close the conference room if there is building work going on.    Advice to customers, confirm the building work is finished.....

Freezing cold and both having missed lunch we were hunting for a nice afternoon tea. First hotel stop was a VERY bad experience so we went a little further and wandered into the Hilton Double Tree. What a difference! Friendly and helpful service from the lovely Daniella made our afternoon really special. Allergy no problem: sandwiches were separated so I didn't have to worry.  A really decent pot of tea and more on the stand than we could eat so they wrapped for us to take home. I'm a bit reluctant to tell you all about this place as I don't want it to change but if you want a really nice tea then visit this hotel but try not to tell too many people!

I had some old 5 pound notes from a previous trip and they helped me trade them in for the new bills.    The Double Tree does not have the same charm as the Bonnington.

Any hotel located at an international airport should take into consideration a few amenities.  For example, there was no water provided in the room. Drinking glasses were in the bedroom rather than the bathroom. The sink faucet was too short and didn't fully extend over the sink, resulting in a lot of water on the counter and the floor!

The hotel has been undergoing renovations for roughly the last year; the west wing is the place to be, as the rooms there (certainly the ones I've stayed in) are top notch. The rooms in the \"Tower\" (where the Sky Bar is located) are not so good; they're dated and badly in need of updating.  Prices are generally good (for London) although this is a popular conference venue and when there's a conference on the hotel gets very crowded and noisy.  There are some good restaurants nearby, mostly Middle-Eastern (Lebanese, Persian etc) on Edgware Road.

Like most European hotels, the rooms are very small, but the rooms at the Hilton London Metropole are cosy and comfortable. Closet space is decent, with good quality toiletries in the bathroom. I loved the little window seat, but it's position next to the luggage rack made it awkward to sit down.  Entertainment channels are very limited with just BBC 1 and 2, ITV and Channel 4 for English general entertainment, the rest being sport and foreign language. There are also a good selection of recent general and adult movies at a price.

The staff is a big plus and will try their best to be sure you are happy.  Breakfast buffet in the mornings is excellent with a wide variety of dishes.  The location could not be better--only a couple blocks away is the British Museum, and tube stops 2 or 3 blocks away make travel further afield convenient.  The only \"But\" is the quality of the rooms: the cheapest ones are very small and dated; spend a little more and get a better room.  Initially our room was one of the small ones, but we upgraded and were very glad we did.  i would probably stay here again if I was going to see museums and other things of interest, etc., in this area of the city.

{"hotel": "DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - West End", "review": "I was so looking forward to some rest in a bit of plushness.  After days of business travelling, I chose a Hilton for the last two days to relax and unwind a bit because, Hilton is (or should be) synonymous high quality.  Not the DT West End.  I have stayed in Hiltons before and have never been disappointed, this is a first.  The rooms are quite old fashioned and gloomy but more that this, our bathroom was rather dirty.  I wiped the shelf clean of its dust to put my toiletries on.  The skirting boards had clearly not been wiped for ages, I wiped a bit myself to show the manager and they kindly offered to deep clean the room.  Later I returned to the room and although something had been done the skirting boards were still dirty.  Then I discovered a nasty splodge of the nasal", "title": "Disappointing and not very clean", "rating": "30", "date": " April 2015"},

We called in advance for an early check in which we were told was no problem. Check in was fast and we were greeted very warmly, provided cookies and coffee vouchers, upgraded to a delux room (am hhonors member) and granted a late check out. Our room 225 was v large for a central London hotel, with a big comfy bed and heard no noise from other rooms. We couldn't get the AC to work but that wasn't a problem as it wasn't overly hot. Breakfast was good and all the staff we interacted with were very friendly. Check out was again quick & overall was very impressed by this hotel.

The hotel is within walking distance to attractions and theatres. It is very well designed and looks great.  On arrival we were greeted by a lovely member of staff and a warm cookie. Yes a literally a warm cookie...  Unfortunately our room was not ready at check in time. However we were upgraded to a business suite free of charge and were given complementary drinks at the bar until our room was ready. So really can't complain !   The room itself was as expected from Hilton and looked as most do with this chain. In the room was a birthday card and cake from the hotel which was a nice touch.

On arrival I asked if we could transfer to another Hilton that was better equipped for families. The hotel refused even though they could see the children's dissapointment. Our room was very small  to a point that we couldn't even walk around it. The cooked breakfast was awful. The worst we've had in a Hilton. It was barely warm. Great place for bacteria to breed.

The public areas and bar are bustling but check-in was quick. The Hilton Honours room I had was nice although a little smaller than I'm used to.

Unfortunately the walls are very thin and you can hear everything going on in next doors' bathroom as though the guests were in your own room.  In the morning there was absolutely no hot water so I ended up having to have a cold shower. I mentioned this on check-out and the receptionist didn't seem terribly surprised.

The only good thing about the room was it was at least quiet and still managed to squeeze in all the regular stuff. I transferred to the Doubletree Tower Hill after one night and I felt human again.

One cannot use a USB stick in the business centre 'for security reasons' so, unless all your material is on a 'cloud' somewhere, you are going to be limited as to what you can do. The laundry - came back very hard (not starched) and extremely expensive.
