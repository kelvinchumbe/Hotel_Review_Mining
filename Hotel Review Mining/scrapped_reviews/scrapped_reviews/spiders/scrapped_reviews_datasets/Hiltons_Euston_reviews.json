No bedside table so had to move/use the small table in the room, no water on arrival but there was some on the second day.  The prices seem to have kept on creeping & now this hotel is expensive for what you get.

One drawback is the flight of steps at the entrance (and the smokers congregating there.)  We had room 318 at the side, quiet and comfortable.

This wasn\u2019t an option as my room faced the main road. It seems that all guests had suffered the same issue. The stay was unbearable and I did write in to complain. The manager,Mr Vijayanand Devarajan, replied offering me 10% of the room cost as a refund. I had spent over \u00a3250 on the room for the night and felt that this was unacceptable.

{"hotel": "Hilton London Euston", "review": "I've stayed here a number of times and I've never been disappointed. The bed is comfortable and the rooms are adequately sized with all the appropriate facilities. As such, it's a relatively basic hotel, compared to other Hilton properties in London, but acts as a good base when in the capital. Prior to the global crisis, breakfast was nice and varied and the restaurant served nice food in the evenings. The staff, front desk and food & beverage, are friendly.   I've also stayed post-lockdown and my stay was pleasant, although different with certain restrictions in place, no restaurant and only packed breakfast eaten in your room. In the circumstances, still a pleasant stay.   No complaints, and I recommend it.", "title": "Consistently good", "rating": "50", "date": " July 2020"},

This time I gave a chance to this small hotel located few blocks away from King Cross/St Pancras stations. It was certainly the right choice.

Check in was easy and the check out time is convenient. However, our stay quickly became stressful and very disappointing. We were traveling with our 4-month old baby and was hoping everything would work smoothly and even rang in advance to double check everything was ok with the room and reserved a baby cot for the room. We arrived at the hotel to check in and the gentleman on the reception desk said he was happy to check us in but that he would need to change our previously reserved room which had the baby cot reserved for it to another room but would ensure that the baby cot was moved to the new room.

{"hotel": "Hilton London Euston", "review": "I never write reviews but being a visitor from Down Under and travelling to London, I am utterly shocked at the way my family\u2019s concerns were handled. We were disappointed in the misleading internet fee charged to our room. Don\u2019t be tricked with the \u201cfree\u201d voucher when you\u2019re redirected to the wifi service. Apparently if you input your Surname and Room and then the FREE promo voucher code, otherwise a minimum fee of 20 pounds per night is charged automatically. Yes, without legal signage specified via any known contract. This is misleading, ripping off guests and against the law.   The staff weren\u2019t very helpful, ushered us away and requested us to dispute it elsewhere. It\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s about the principle.
